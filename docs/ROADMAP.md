# Roadmap — what was done and what's next

This file tracks the audit-execution work and the deferred items.

---

## Phase 1 · Critical fixes — ✅ COMPLETE

Six commits on `refactor/audit-execution` (after the `main` snapshot at `50f7497`):

| Commit | Purpose | Files touched |
|---|---|---|
| `d1401a5` `chore` | Archive 12 Python scripts + 7 `_v*_styles.css` + temp logs + `agent-handoff/` snapshot. Consolidate docs into `docs/`. Project root went from 25+ entries to 6. | move-only |
| `eef5ad8` `chore(assets)` | Generate favicons (16/32/96/180/192/512 + .ico) and 6 page-specific OG share images (1200×630) via Pillow. Inject favicon + OG meta tags into all 6 pages. Add PWA manifest. | 6 HTML + 14 image files + manifest |
| `71cabdd` `perf(images)` | Compress hero JPGs (q=78), generate WebP variants and mobile-cropped versions. Wire `<picture>` with WebP-first sources on the homepage collage. CSS hero rules use `image-set()` with mobile media queries. | 5 JPGs + 15 new images + index.html + styles.css |
| `00455c3` `feat(booking)` | Add email + clipboard fallbacks to the WhatsApp flow. Three actions: WhatsApp primary, mailto: with full dossier, copy with `execCommand` fallback. | booking-form.js |
| `ec204db` `fix(robustness)` | Safe-localStorage wrapper, cobe CDN graceful fallback, lightbox focus restoration + keyboard activation, `:has()` nav-push fallback via body class, press-strip honesty audit. | enhance.js + enhance-pro.js + globe.js + styles.css |
| `27ae633` `perf` | Font subset (drop italic 300, add 700), mobile globe `mapSamples`, service worker (offline cache). | enhance.js + globe.js + sw.js + 6 HTML |

## Phase 2 · Refactoring — ⏳ DEFERRED

### Why deferred

These three changes need either a build step (Vite / 11ty) or a sibling-wide module conversion. Doing them piecewise without that infrastructure introduces subtle timing bugs (data not loaded before consumer reads it; CSS `@import` chain causes render-blocking waterfall; module/non-module mixed scripts behave differently at boot).

The audit recommended Vite. The previous user direction was "no build step". This is a decision point you need to make.

### Phase 2.1 · Extract data to JSON

**What:** Move trip data, hotel data, agency contact info into `src/data/*.json` so the agency owner can edit one file instead of finding-and-replacing across 6 HTML pages and 5 JS files.

**Files needed:**
- `src/data/agency.json` — `{ name, phone, phoneDisplay, whatsapp, email, address, city }`
- `src/data/trips.json` — array of `{ slug, region, name, subtitle, priceFromDA, accent, departures, hotels, heroImage, summary }`
- `src/data/hotels.json` — keyed by id, `{ name, stars, city, board, image }`

**Why:** Today, changing the phone number requires editing ≥10 places. Trip price changes require editing 4 places (HTML, calculator.js, enhance.js `ALL_TRIPS`, globe.js).

**Implementation paths:**
1. **With Vite (recommended):** import JSON, template-render HTML, compile-time inline. Zero runtime cost.
2. **Without build:** Convert all 5 JS files from IIFE to ES modules, then `import` the data. Mixed module/non-module load order makes this fragile.
3. **Pragmatic middle:** Generate the JSON files for documentation + write a small Python "build" script (`_archive/migrations/_apply_data.py`) that injects from JSON into HTML/JS via regex when run manually.

### Phase 2.2 · Split `styles.css`

**What:** Break the 5,888-line monolith into ITCSS-style modules:

```
src/styles/
  01-tokens.css       ← :root + light theme
  02-reset.css
  03-base.css
  04-layout.css
  05-components/      ← nav, hero, trip-card, hotel-card, calculator, …
  06-pages/           ← home.css, trip.css
  07-utils.css
  main.css            ← @imports the modules in order
```

**Why:** Currently `.btn--primary` is defined 4 times, `.site-nav` 3 times — cascade conflicts that take 100 `!important` declarations to resolve. Modular structure makes drift impossible.

**Implementation:** A bundler concatenates them at build time. Without one, native `@import` works but creates a render-blocking waterfall (one HTTP request per `@import`). Don't ship native `@import` to production.

### Phase 2.3 · Split `enhance-pro.js`

**What:** Break the 571-line IIFE with 13 numbered sections into focused ES modules:

```
src/scripts/components/
  reveals.js
  parallax.js
  magnetic-buttons.js
  scroll-progress.js
  fab.js
  trust-strip.js
  sticky-bar.js
  lightbox.js
  accordion.js
  press-strip.js
  value-props.js
src/scripts/main.js  ← imports + boots in order
```

**Why:** When section 14 needs adding, there's no structural ceiling on the current IIFE. Single-responsibility modules are testable, tree-shakeable, lazy-loadable.

**Implementation:** All consumers (`calculator.js`, `booking-form.js`, `enhance.js`) need to become modules too, or stay IIFE and the new module sits alongside. Either path is risky without tests; a build step makes the migration safe.

## Phase 3 · Optimization — partially ✅

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Font subset | ✅ commit `27ae633` |
| Mobile globe `mapSamples` | ✅ commit `27ae633` |
| Service worker | ✅ commit `27ae633` |
| Image pipeline (AVIF + WebP + JPG, 3 widths) | ✅ partial (WebP + 2 widths in `71cabdd`) |
| `fetchpriority` cleanup | ✅ commit `71cabdd` |
| Self-host cobe | ⏳ deferred — esm.sh bundle pulls phenomenon dep chain too tangled to bundle without a real bundler |
| Critical CSS inlined | ⏳ needs build step |
| HTTP cache headers | ⏳ host-side config (Netlify `_headers` / Vercel `vercel.json`) |
| Lazy-load `calculator.js`/`booking-form.js` | ⏳ deferred (intersection observer + dynamic import) |

---

## Phase 4 · UX/UI Upgrade — ⏳ DEFERRED

| Item | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Arabic (RTL) version | L | Needs translator + `lang="ar"` switcher + `dir="rtl"` style audit |
| Real testimonials with photos | M | Needs agency to collect consent + portrait photos |
| Real lead-capture form | M | Pick: Formspree (no-code), Cloudflare Worker (free), Supabase |
| Mobile drawer nav (focus trap, scroll lock) | S | Improve current hamburger |
| Lightbox a11y pass | partial ✅ | Focus restore + keyboard activation done in `ec204db`. Still need: focus trap inside lightbox, `aria-modal=true`. |
| Calculator sticky-pill on mobile | S | Show running total in viewport at all times |

---

## Phase 5 · Scalability — not started

| Item | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Lead capture backend | **Cloudflare Worker** writing to **Airtable** (free tier covers ≤1k submissions/mo) |
| Analytics | **Plausible** (privacy-first, GDPR-friendly, ~$9/mo for 10k pageviews) — track WhatsApp click + email click + scroll depth |
| CMS | **Decap CMS** (Git-based, no DB) → trip + hotel content edited via web UI, commits to repo, rebuilds on push |
| A/B testing | **GrowthBook** (open-source) + Cloudflare Worker for edge flag |
| Multi-currency | DZD + EUR + USD with currency switcher |
| `Schema.org` rich data | `TouristTrip`, `Offer`, `Reservation` per trip page |
| Sitemap.xml + robots.txt | Generate from `trips.json` |
| Lighthouse-CI | Block PRs that regress LCP / CLS / TBT |

---

## Performance budget (target, enforce in CI)

| Metric | Budget |
|---|---|
| LCP (3G mobile) | ≤ 2.0 s |
| CLS | ≤ 0.05 |
| INP | ≤ 200 ms |
| Total page weight (HTML + CSS + JS, gzipped) | ≤ 80 KB / page |
| Hero image at mobile breakpoint | ≤ 100 KB |
| Lighthouse Performance | ≥ 90 mobile, ≥ 95 desktop |
| Lighthouse Accessibility | 100 |

## Open questions for the project owner

1. **Build step (Vite or 11ty)?** Most of Phase 2 is blocked on this decision.
2. **Real press / partner relationships?** The press strip is currently 5 honest commitments. If actual outlets exist, they go back in (with proof).
3. **Arabic version scope?** Full translation, or just nav + key headers?
4. **Backend for lead capture?** Pick Formspree / Cloudflare / Supabase / serverless.
5. **Testimonials sourcing?** Need real customers + signed consent.
6. **Domain?** All canonical URLs assume `https://alliance-travel.dz/` — confirm or update.

## How to continue

```bash
git checkout main                        # see the pristine snapshot
git checkout refactor/audit-execution    # the working branch with all 6 audit commits
git log --oneline                        # review each atomic commit
```

When ready to merge:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff refactor/audit-execution
```

Or open a PR if a hosting platform / GitHub is connected.
